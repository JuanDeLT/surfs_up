# Statistical Analysis with SQLite datastorage

## Overview of Project

This project is meant to extract data stored in a SQLite database in order to run statistical analysis on the climate data of Oahu.

- June has higher minimum, average, and maximum temperatures than December.
- June has a smaller standard deviation than December.
- June has higher quartile measurements than December.

## Potential Future Queries
- One additional query that I would perform would be temperatures for El Nino and La Nina years to try to predict when the next storms would hit in order to determine if they will happen soon. 
- Another query that I would perform is the average temperatures in March and September as they are the beginning of the last two remaining seasons.

## Summary of Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis of June and December in Hawaii would indicate that the climate is pleasant year round on the island of Oahu. Average temperatures for both months are in the 70s along with max temperature readings in the 80s. The standard deviation is also smaller for June, which shows that the temperatures generally stay around the average for that month more so than in December. The quartile measurements for the month of June are also higher than for the month of December. Despite the fact that June consistently beats December in terms of weather and consistency, December's measurements are not that much lower than Junes overall. Since June and December represent the beginning of summer and winter these readings would imply a consistently pleasant climate on the island of Oahu
